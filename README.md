# pkmn-dreamland
Place where we research Pok√®mon Dream World (Game Sync in particular)

## Terms
For the sake of being concise, I have made a few acronyms:
- DWGS: Dream World Game Sync
- PDW: Pokemon Dream World
- GS: Game Sync
- DW: Dream World

## Why is this project called Dream Land?
It's named Dream Land after Mr. Sandman's Taunt (Saying "Dreeam Laand, Boo!"), and his signature move ("Dreamland Express"). I chose this name because of it's similarity to the real game's name; Dream World.

## Research History
